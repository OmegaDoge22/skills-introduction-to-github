Hello! My name is Hunter Anderson and I am currently a senior attending Southwest Career and Technical Academy. I am enrolled inside of the Digital game program and have a very strong passion of playing video games in my spare time. 
I have a very strong interest in game development as I already have a solid understanding of how to code simple programs and find it satisfying when I eventually create a program through code that I have made. The idea that there is limitless potential in what I create as a video game is really fascinating to me and is one of the motivating factors as to why i'm intrigued by game design.
I am already very informed in javascript and know how to work well with that programming language, however I have very surface level knowledge or none at all for the other programming languages. As a result, I am going to begin learning a new programming language, most likely C# as it is heavily prevelant and I want to compare and contrast the different types of coding languages.
